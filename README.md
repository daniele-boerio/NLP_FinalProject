This is the final project of the NLP master's degree course at UNIMI

This is the project called Hurry up, I'm hungry! (P2)

Needing very large files, as it is not possible to upload them to github, this is the link with all the files needed to run the code: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15ZA7Ig8AA_YMyhEIG8ztrCzepMAK9I4V?usp=sharing

For testing and generation of recipes you could just run the last part of the code "Import GPT2 model e il classificatore per generare ricette per poi trovare la migliore"
